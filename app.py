            You are an expert AI resume assistant.

            Your task is to help tailor a resume for a specific job by performing the following step-by-step analysis. Use the resume and job description content provided.

            ---

            üìå Step 1: Initial Analysis
            Analyze the following job description and identify the key skills, experience, and qualifications required for the role. Present this information as a bulleted list.

            {jd_text[:1200]}...

            ---

            üìå Step 2: Resume Review
            Review the resume provided below and list the skills, experiences, and qualifications it currently highlights.

            {resume_text[:1200]}...

            ---

            üìå Step 3: Gap Analysis and Optimization
            Compare the key requirements from the job description with the resume content. Identify:
            - Any gaps in skills, qualifications, or experience
            - Areas where the resume could be improved or better aligned
            - Specific suggestions for additions, improvements, or keyword usage

            ---

            üìå Step 4: Tailoring the Resume Sections

            **Professional Summary**  
            Rewrite the professional summary section (if available) to reflect relevant skills and experiences for a [Job Title] position at [Company Name]. Emphasize the most important skills from the job description.

            **Work Experience**  
            Suggest edits to improve alignment with the job responsibilities. Focus on measurable outcomes and quantified achievements. Use action verbs and mirror the job‚Äôs key responsibilities.

            **Skills**  
            Suggest additional keywords or phrases to include in the skills section, based on the job description.

            ---

            üìå Step 5: Final Review
            Review the updated version of the resume for:
            - Clarity and conciseness
            - Impact and relevance
            - Overall polish for submission

            Be concise but specific in your recommendations. Output should be structured clearly so the user can copy and apply improvements directly.
